# Bias-Free-Hatespeech-Detection
IRE (Monsoon-2018) major project for building a bias free hatespeech detection classifier. 

The aim of this project is to propose novel idea for bias-free hatespeech detection. Among multiple methods like: 
Transfer Learning, Adversarial Approaches for Gender-Free 
Hatespeech Detection, Bias-Free Deep Learning architecture for classification etc we have implemented an 
Adversary based approach for achieveing the said task.
